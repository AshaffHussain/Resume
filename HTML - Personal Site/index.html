        <p><em>Product Manager</em></p>
        <p>I'm Ashaff Hussain, a son, husband, and as of late, a sleep-deprived father. I've been building products for 6+ years of my career for startups and enterprises. This experience has truly helped me develop as a person who loves to build
          delightful product experiences that solve customer pain points. I have experience in growth, product-market fit, discovery, design, development, launch, post-launch, and implementation of product success frameworks throughout the lifecycle
          for
          digital products. While solving user pain points through digital products has turned out to be my calling, I'm also an amateur bonsai artist, but I'll write about that on a different day.</p>
